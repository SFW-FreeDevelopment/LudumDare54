THEME: Limited Space

--TREVOR--
1.
HUMAN IDEA:
Its the end of the world. There is a spaceship that will take you off planet. There is limited space. First come first serve

2.
AI IDEAS
Literally all of them are about a spaceship with limited resources wtf 
Lets not do a spaceship then. 

How about a game where you are underground in a cave and there is limited space so you have to dig out more space so that you can use it to do shit but if you make the space too big then it will cave in and then you have trouble
a cross between dig dug and amoung us

--CHRIS--
Swarm game with spawning enemies. Room gets smaller as more enemies spawn. Scored based on enemies killed and time survived. Top down view works best.
Tag me later and let me know what y’all decide on

--TYLER--
top down shooting swarm-ish  game, where you have to get from point A to point B, but when you kill enemies they remove the terrain with them so you have to be careful when and where you kill them

--KALEB--
1.
Submarine game where you are in a cramped submarine deep underwater, and the players must manage resources, repair systems, and fend off sea monsters while trying to reach the surface.

2.
Another idea is that you’re in a  small mining vessel and the players harvest resources from asteroids. The players  must carefully manage cargo space, energy, and mining equipment while avoiding collisions

3.
This one is a simple one but you are trapped in a maze of moving crates and boxes and the player must navigate the limited space to find the exit before time runs out.

--AUSTIN--
Puzzle game with turning thing and layers

--STEVEN--
LABYRINTH???

Title: The Bunker

Concept: You are a scientist who must send a crucial alert to the surviving government shelter as the world was hit by a sudden catastrophic event. Although you've reached the bunker, the door shuts behind you, and you are left alone without communication access. As events begin to unravel, you realize there's something strange going on within the limited space of the bunker.

Gameplay: The Bunker is a first-person horror game that puts players in a confined space where every object in that space can be a hazard. The game is set inside a government shelter transformed into a bunker as the world above has been destroyed. 

Players progress through the game by collecting notes, codes, and items that aid their escape or uncover the dark secrets of the bunker. Players should expect to encounter different environmental puzzles, creepy hazards, and terrifying enemies as they explore the bunker's tight corridors.

The game will also utilize a sanity mechanic that will slowly decrease if players are not in light or when exposed to scary situations. As players' sanity declines, the game will become more difficult, and enemies may start to appear in unusual and unpredictable places.

Visuals: The game's graphics will be atmospheric with a low light setting and eerie sound effects that heighten the players' fear. The bunker's industrial design will look abandoned but sterile, with the surroundings looking like they have recently suffered damage from the apocalypse.

Target audience: The Bunker is for the horror game fans who enjoy the feeling of being trapped and the tension. The game is recommended only for adults due to violence, gore, and intense scary scenes.

This one is a simple one but you are trapped in a maze of moving crates and boxes and the player must navigate the limited space to find the exit before time runs out.
